# Atlas Globe

A detailed, colourful, installable world globe (PWA). Stack any of ~140 map filters, morph between 14
projections, travel through 123,000 years of borders and a billion years of plate tectonics, and leave it
spinning full-screen as an ambient display. English and Spanish.

- **App:** https://divaor.github.io/globe/ (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main`)
- **Install:** open it in Chrome, Edge or Safari, then "Install app" / "Add to Home Screen". Works offline after the first visit.

## What it does

- **Political map (default):** every country has its own shade; the colour family shows its continent.
  Capitals, cities and sea names appear as you zoom. Tap a country for a card with its flag and facts.
- **Navigation:** drag with fling, pinch, mouse wheel, double-tap, keyboard; search any country or city.
- **14 projections, smooth morph:** Globe, Plate Carrée, Mercator, Miller, Robinson, Winkel Tripel, Equal Earth,
  Natural Earth, Mollweide, Gall–Peters, Eckert IV, azimuthal equidistant, Lambert azimuthal, stereographic.
  Every filter (vector and imagery) works in every projection.
- **Filter stack:** turn on several filters, set opacity and order; each has a legend (tap an entry to highlight
  its countries) and values in the country card. Filters include:
  - Political: time zones with live clocks, alliances (EU, NATO, G20, BRICS…), government, independence…
  - People: population, density glow, life expectancy, median age, languages (main / family / branch), religion…
  - Climate & weather: Köppen climate zones, temperature, rainfall, sea temperature, animated winds.
  - Landforms & water: mountain ranges, deserts, plateaus, peaks, rivers and lakes, shaded relief, elevation.
  - Flora & fauna: vegetation zones, forest cover, animal realms with the Wallace Line, 60 iconic animals,
    animated migrations, biodiversity hotspots, national animals and plants.
  - Earth science: tectonic plates by boundary type, volcanoes, animated ocean currents.
  - Economy & energy: GDP, income groups, top producers of 21 resources (oil, lithium, cobalt…), CO₂, renewables…
  - Culture & fun: flags on the map, national colours, driving side, calling codes, Olympic medals and more.
  - Imagery: NASA Blue Marble, yesterday's real satellite view (NASA GIBS), shaded relief, ETOPO.
  - Live: day and night with city lights, earthquakes (USGS), weather now (Open-Meteo), the ISS.
- **Time travel:** borders through time (54 maps, 123,000 BC → 2010) with start/end, play, speed and
  "What changed"; Pangea to today (Merdith et al. 2021 plate model, 1,000 Ma → today) with the geological time scale.
  Researched stories play step by step on the map, with territory, routes, markers and a card with a Wikipedia
  picture for every person, work, place, dish or building:
  - Wars and conquests: 26 conflicts, from Alexander and Rome to the World Wars, with battles and aftermath.
  - Eras and ideas: 11 stories, from classical Athens and the Islamic Golden Age to the Renaissance, the
    Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, modern art, rights and freedom, the Space Age and computing.
  - Food through time: 10 stories (the dawn of farming, maize, wheat, rice, the potato, the Columbian Exchange,
    spices, sugar, coffee, tea and chocolate) and 248 dishes of the world, with where and when they were born.
  - Great structures: about 220 structures from Göbekli Tepe to the Burj Khalifa (why, how and by whom), the
    Seven Wonders, the race to the sky, and bridges, canals and dams.
  - Browse and search every item of a story or a whole collection; shared links open a story at its step.
- **Explore:** measure distances (great circles, flight time), compare two countries, "true size" of countries.
- **Learn & play:** quizzes (find the country, flags, capitals, where in the world, when was it built or made,
  dishes of the world, which era), guided tours (our planet, eight cities through time, history and culture),
  "On this day" (Wikipedia).
- **Personal:** visited / want-to-go travel map with stats, notes per country, PNG / 4K / phone wallpaper export.
- **Ambient mode:** full-screen rotating globe with your filters, screen kept awake, clock, optional filter cycling.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build (with service worker) into dist/
```

Browser checks (Playwright, pre-installed in CI images):
`node scripts/test/shot.mjs <url> out.png`, `scripts/test/hero-shots.mjs`, `phone.mjs`, `live-mock.mjs` (live APIs mocked).

## Adding a filter

A filter is one object implementing `LayerDef` (`src/layers/types.ts`). Most data filters are one call:

```ts
import { numericLayer } from './choropleth';
export const myFilter = numericLayer({
  id: 'my-filter', category: 'economy', icon: '📈',
  name: { en: 'My filter', es: 'Mi filtro' }, desc: { en: '…', es: '…' },
  palette: SEQUENTIAL.viridis, scale: 'log',
  values: () => ({ USA: 1, MEX: 2 /* ISO alpha-3 → value */ }),
});
```

Register it in `src/layers/index.ts`, or drop a module in `src/layers/packs/` whose default export registers
filters. Even simpler: add a field to `public/data/attributes/countries.json` (with `label_en`, `label_es`,
`type`…) and it becomes a filter automatically.

## Data

All data are pre-built and committed under `public/data/`; the scripts that build them are in `scripts/data/`
(each folder has a README) and every folder has a `SOURCES.md` with sources, licences and attribution.
Main sources: Natural Earth (public domain), NASA Blue Marble and GIBS, NOAA ETOPO1 and ERSST, ECMWF ERA-Interim,
GPCP, Köppen–Geiger (Kottek/Rubel), GeoNames (CC BY 4.0), aourednik/historical-basemaps (GPL-3.0),

The Time travel stories are written from Wikipedia and the sources listed in each story
(`scripts/data/conflicts/README.md`, `scripts/data/STORIES.md`); item pictures are Wikipedia page images,
loaded from Wikipedia when a card opens.
